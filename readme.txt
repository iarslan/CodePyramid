This project, created for CSCE 361, is an instructional website designed to teach young students the basics of code.
The website teaches HTML, CSS, and Javascript; it also allows students to register and sign in to view their progress. 
Behind the scenes, it is a MVC-style site written mostly in C#. The quizzes, and the dynamic code execution, are written in Javascript.

<h2>How to display your new website</h2>
<p>
    Now that you have some HTML code to display, let’s see how it looks!  Before you run any computer program, you have to save it.  You can save your file by pressing CTRL+S, or by clicking the SAVE button in the toolbar.  After your program is saved, you can run it.  If you’re using Notepad++, you can either click Run in the toolbar, or press F5 to open up the run window.  Click on run, and then select your .htm file.  Alternatively, you can drag your file into an empty tab on Google Chrome or Firefox, and it’ll open your new website.
